So what is this folder used for ?

Well, we have created a new GANs architecture that includes an image classifier. Thus, there are 3 networks.
We are trying to do efficient semi-supervised learning. With few labels, still manage to train an accurate classifier.
You can control the ratio of used labels in the hyperparameters file via "LABELLED_FRACTION"

Our main difficulty as of late July is that the classifier overfits. We reach a high training accuracy but testing accuracy quickly flattens.

A few ideas to prevent that:
-early stopping
-separate the classifier from the discriminator early, in order to have a small classifier
-more dropout
-more weight-decay
-lighten the shared discriminator structure
-...

Once this is fixed, one should vary the LABELLED FRACTION and note down testing accuracy, then plot the curve.
